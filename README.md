# The Skin Patient

## Project Basis
For my last Flatiron School Project, I've built a skincare social media app using Postgres, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, and React. In the application, you log in to an account to see reviews. As a user you can review products or add them to your products list or your wishlist. 

## Project Use
The main idea behind this project was to create a skin care application to allow people to share their opinions on the various skin care products out there as well as track what they have in their posession and what products they want to get. Often times we can forget how may skin care products we actually have because we store them away and leave out the few we are currently using. This app can help recognize how many products we have and remind us to swap in our 'old goodies' over our trendy not as effective items. 

## How to Use
1. Log In or Sign Up
2. Using the Navigation Bar click My Account to access your account information.
3. When in your account information page, you can edit your account info by clicking, Edit Account. This allows you to change your bio, username, or image.
4. You can also permanently delete your account using the Delete Account Button. This will prompt a pop up to confirm the deletion of your account.
5. Back on the Home page, you can click the navigation button again to select Products to see all products available.
6. On the Products page, you can see more product info by clicking on a product.
7. After clicking on a product you can then read reviews other users have left on the product, write your own review for the product, add the product to your products list, or add it to your wishlist.
8. When you click Write Review, a texbox as well as number selection will pop up allowing you to select your rating and write your review.
9. When you click Add to My Products or Add to Wishlist, a pop up confirming it has been added will show up on the screen.
10. By Clicking the logo or Home in the navigation pop up, you will be taken home.
11. Back home you will be able to select My Products and My Wishlist to see the items you have added to these respective lists.
